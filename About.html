    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I’m <b>Shriyanshu Kumar Kapsime</b>, a first-semester Computer Science and Engineering student at RNS Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
      I’m originally from Chatra, Jharkhand but My passion for technology and problem-solving inspired me to move to Bangalore, the heart of India's tech ecosystem, to begin my journey as a software engineer.
      I’m currently learning web development as the first step toward building a strong foundation in software engineering.
      I am enjoying this new journet till now and hope it remains same. Through college projects, online courses, and hackathons, I aim to strengthen my skills and grow into a developer capable of solving real-world problems.

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>
      I have a keen interest in <b>Web Development</b> and really excited to learn more new technologies. I enjoy exploring new ideas that come to me from observing everyday problems around me. Web development and coding give me the tools to turn those ideas into simple, practical solutions.
      Apart from coding my hobbies include consuming indian politics, playing chess, listening to desi hiphop etc.

    <h2>Why I Want to Join the MUN Technical Team</h2>
    <p>
        I would love to contribute to the club with my skills but on a personal level,
       Being in Technical Team of a official and active club like RNSIT-MUN will give me wonderful exposure to real life challenges involved in coding.
       It will also allow me to polish my skills in a real world scenario and not just private projects as our codes gets tested really only when real users use it.
       Being in Technical Team of MUN club will also allow me to interact and learn from seniors which will definetly helps me in future.
